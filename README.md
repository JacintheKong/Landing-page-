## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. This project is converted to an interactive one through more HTML, CSS and Javascript. The original HTML and CSS files are modified, together with the JavaScript file.

The project is built With Visual Studio Code.

The landing page gives a brief introduction to a STEM related program sponsored by STEM USA and Boston Children’s Museum. It is divided into five sections: Partners, What is STEM, Brain Building, Asking Questions and Guidance, with the contact information at the bottom.

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the corresponding section, and the background color of the section changes while scrolling through the page. Also, there's a scroll to top button at the bottom of the page.

On computer browsers, the navbar hides when it is scrolled down and appears when scrolled up. On phone browsers, the navbar on the right side slides in and out through the button in the upper right. The right section can also be directed by clicking the item from the navigation menu.
